EXPERIENCE
Copart — Senior/Lead Full Stack Engineer (Dallas, TX) | Jan 2023 – Present

- Implemented React 18.3 dashboards leveraging Concurrent Mode/Suspense for smoother data-driven UI and code-split bundles.
- Deployed workloads on AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, S3) and EKS (Kubernetes + Helm), with IAM-based least-privilege and autoscaling.
- Designed REST/GraphQL contracts with pagination, versioning, and OpenAPI/Swagger; secured services via OAuth2/JWT and policy checks.
- Orchestrated Python ETL to integrate fraud-detection models into request flows, improving latency and decision quality.
- Built Grafana/Prometheus/Elasticsearch dashboards and alerting; standardized Jenkins + GitOps pipelines and code quality (SonarQube), mentoring junior devs.

- Built Flask/Django services for data processing and integration, including structured logging and health/readiness probes.
- Authored and maintained Apache Airflow DAGs with custom operators/plugins for reliable ETL scheduling and monitoring.
- Tuned PostgreSQL (indexes, query plans, connection pooling) and implemented caching with Redis for read-heavy paths.
